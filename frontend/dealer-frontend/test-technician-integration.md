# Technician Admin Integration Test

## Overview
This document outlines the testing steps to verify that the technician admin endpoints have been successfully integrated into the frontend admin dashboard.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New Technician Tab
- Added "Technician Management" tab to the admin dashboard navigation
- Positioned between "Dealer Management" and "Post Management"

### 2. Technician Management Features
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Shows total, active, new, and inactive technicians
- **Search & Filtering**: Search by name/email/location, filter by location and experience
- **Technician Table**: Displays all technicians with pagination
- **Performance Metrics**: Shows top performers by earnings and acceptance rate
- **Actions**: View details, edit profile, delete technician

### 3. API Integration
- Integrated with all technician admin endpoints from the backend
- Uses the API gateway routing pattern
- Handles pagination, filtering, and error states

### 4. Modals
- **Technician Details Modal**: Shows comprehensive technician information
- **Edit Profile Modal**: Allows editing of technician details
- **Delete Confirmation**: Confirms technician deletion with warnings

## Testing Steps

### 1. Access the Admin Dashboard
```bash
# Navigate to the admin dashboard
http://localhost:3000/admin-dashboard
```

### 2. Verify Technician Tab
- Look for "Technician Management" tab in the left sidebar
- Click on it to verify it loads without errors
- Check that the tab shows the correct title in the header

### 3. Test Statistics Cards
- Verify that 4 statistics cards are displayed:
  - Total Technicians
  - Active Technicians  
  - New This Month
  - Inactive Technicians
- Check that the cards have proper styling and hover effects

### 4. Test Search & Filters
- Try searching for technicians by name, email, or location
- Test location filter
- Test experience filter
- Verify search button works and refreshes results

### 5. Test Technician Table
- Verify the table displays technician data
- Check that pagination works (if there are multiple pages)
- Test the refresh button
- Verify table styling and responsiveness

### 6. Test Actions
- **View Details**: Click the eye icon to open details modal
- **Edit Profile**: Click the pencil icon to open edit modal
- **Delete**: Click the trash icon to trigger delete confirmation

### 7. Test Modals
- **Details Modal**: Verify all technician information is displayed
- **Edit Modal**: Test form fields and save functionality
- **Delete Modal**: Verify confirmation dialog and delete action

### 8. Test Performance Metrics
- Check that top performers section displays correctly
- Verify earnings and acceptance rate calculations
- Test responsive layout on different screen sizes

## Expected API Calls

When the technicians tab is active, the following API calls should be made:

```javascript
// Get technicians list
GET /technician/api/technicians/admin/technicians?page=0&size=20

// Get technician statistics  
GET /technician/api/technicians/admin/technicians/statistics

// Get performance metrics
GET /technician/api/technicians/admin/performance-metrics?page=0&size=20&sortBy=totalEarnings&sortOrder=desc
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. API Connection Errors
- Verify technician service is running on port 8088
- Check API gateway configuration
- Ensure CORS is properly configured

### 2. Data Not Loading
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify API responses in Network tab
- Check if technician data exists in the database

### 3. Styling Issues
- Verify CSS file is properly loaded
- Check for Bootstrap conflicts
- Test responsive design on different screen sizes

### 4. Modal Issues
- Verify all state variables are properly initialized
- Check for missing imports (Form, Row, Col, etc.)
- Test modal open/close functionality

## Success Criteria
