# Counter Offer Fix Summary

## 🎯 **The Problem**

Counter offer submission was getting a **400 Bad Request** error because of incorrect field mapping in the frontend request.

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The frontend modal was sending the correct data structure:

```javascript
{
  postId: post.id,
  counterOfferAmount: formattedAmount,    // ✅ Correct field name
  requestReason: formData.requestReason,  // ✅ Correct field name
  notes: formData.notes,                  // ✅ Correct field name
}
```

But the `submitCounterOffer` function was mapping it incorrectly:

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG MAPPING
const requestBody = {
  counterOfferAmount: counterOfferData.requestedOfferAmount, // Wrong source field
  requestReason: counterOfferData.requestReason, // Correct
  notes: counterOfferData.technicianNotes, // Wrong source field
};
```

## ✅ **The Fix**

Updated the field mapping to match what the modal actually sends:

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT MAPPING
const requestBody = {
  counterOfferAmount: counterOfferData.counterOfferAmount, // Fixed
  requestReason: counterOfferData.requestReason,
  notes: counterOfferData.notes, // Fixed
};
```

## 📋 **Backend Expected Format**

The technician service `CounterOfferRequest` DTO expects:

- `counterOfferAmount` (String, 1-50 chars, required)
- `requestReason` (String, max 500 chars, optional)
- `notes` (String, max 1000 chars, optional)

## 🚀 **Expected Result**

Counter offers should now work correctly:

1. ✅ **Direct Accept**: Already working (posting service)
2. ✅ **Counter Offer Submission**: Should work now (fixed field mapping)
3. ✅ **Counter Offer Status**: Already working (technician service)
4. ✅ **Counter Offer Eligibility**: Already working (technician service)

## 🧪 **How to Test**

1. Login as technician
2. Find any available post
3. Click "Submit Counter Offer"
4. Fill in the form:
   - **Counter Offer Amount**: e.g., "150.00"
   - **Request Reason**: e.g., "Need higher compensation for distance"
   - **Notes**: e.g., "Additional materials required"
5. Submit the form
6. Should see success message instead of 400 error

## 🔧 **Current Architecture**

- **Accept Posts**: Uses posting service `/accept` ✅
- **Counter Offers**: Uses technician service `/counter-offer/{postId}` ✅
- **Mixed Services**: Each service handles what it does best

This hybrid approach makes sense because:

- **Posting Service**: Handles post lifecycle (accept, status updates, dealer operations)
- **Technician Service**: Handles technician-specific features (counter offers, feeds, profiles)

The counter offer should now work end-to-end with proper validation and business rules implemented in the technician service!
